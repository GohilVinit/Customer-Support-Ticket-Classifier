# Customer-Support-Ticket-Classifier
This project classifies customer support tickets by issue type and urgency using traditional ML models, and extracts key entities like product names, dates, and complaint keywords. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and an optional Gradio app for interactive predictions and structured output.
